# GreatLakesWaterQuality

In this report at Midterm_copy.html, we seek to answer the following question based on The Great Lakes Water Quality Monitoring and Surveillance Data: **In which locations/cities of the Great Lakes have the worst water qualities and is there an improvement in water quality in these mostly polluted locations from 2000 to present?** Specifically, we will use the concentration of Phosphorus as the water quality indicator to trace the level of Phosphorus from 2000 to present at different locations.
